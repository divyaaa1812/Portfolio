          My journey into the world of web development began with my work in QA,
          where I honed my skills in identifying bugs, ensuring software
          quality, and understanding the userâ€™s perspective. This experience has
          given me a unique insight into the importance of delivering flawless
          and user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p className="about__info-description">
          What sets me apart is my commitment to continuous learning and
          improvement. I always explore new technologies and techniques to stay
          current in this rapidly evolving field.
        </p>
        <p className="about__info-description">
          Outside of coding, I enjoy playing boardgames, baking cakes and
          cookies, working on DIY projects with my kid. These experiences not
          only enrich my life but also inspire my creativity and problem-solving
          skills.
