          I'm an aspiring Frontend Developer with a strong foundation in Quality
          Assurance (QA). With a passion for creating visually appealing and
          highly functional web applications, I combine my keen eye for detail
          from my QA background with my love for innovative design and seamless
          user experiences.

          My journey into the world of web development began with my work in QA,
          where I honed my skills in identifying bugs, ensuring software
          quality, and understanding the userâ€™s perspective. This experience has
          given me a unique insight into the importance of delivering flawless
          and user-friendly applications.
